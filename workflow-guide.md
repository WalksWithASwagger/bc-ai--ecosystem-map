# BC AI Ecosystem - Workflow Guide

## Overview

This guide outlines the standard workflows for maintaining and expanding the BC AI Ecosystem Community Atlas. It covers research, data entry, validation, outreach, and ongoing maintenance processes.

## Research & Discovery Workflow

### 1. Organization Discovery

#### Primary Sources
- **Event Attendance**: AI meetups, conferences, tech events
- **Community Referrals**: Recommendations from existing contacts
- **Online Research**: LinkedIn, company directories, news articles
- **Government Listings**: BC tech directories, grant recipients
- **Academic Networks**: University research labs, student projects
- **Industry Reports**: Venture capital reports, tech ecosystem studies

#### Research Checklist
- [ ] Verify organization exists and is active
- [ ] Confirm BC presence (HQ, office, or significant operations)
- [ ] Identify AI/tech components in their work
- [ ] Check if already in database
- [ ] Gather basic contact information
- [ ] Note data source and date researched

### 2. Information Gathering

#### Required Information
- Organization name and website
- Geographic location in BC
- Primary category and focus areas
- Basic contact information

#### Recommended Information
- Key personnel and contacts
- Notable projects and achievements
- Company size and founding year
- Current support needs
- Potential collaboration opportunities

#### Research Tools

- Academic publication databases

## MCP-Based Data Entry Workflow

### 1. Pre-Entry Validation (Using MCP)

#### Duplicate Check Process
1. **Query Existing Database**: Use MCP tools to search for potential duplicates
   - Search by organization name variations
   - Check website URLs and LinkedIn profiles
   - Cross-reference contact information and key personnel
2. **Validate Uniqueness**: Ensure organization isn't already in database
3. **Document Search Results**: Record findings to avoid future duplicates

### 2. Initial Entry Process

#### Using MCP Tools for Data Entry
1. **Prepare Organization Data**: Gather information using template from `new_organizations.md`
2. **Validate Fields**: Ensure all data matches database schema requirements
3. **Use MCP Add Operations**: Create new database entries directly via MCP tools
4. **Verify Entry**: Query database to confirm successful addition
5. **Update Status**: Mark organization as âœ… added in `new_organizations.md`

#### Field Guidelines
- **Name**: Use official organization name
- **Category**: Select most appropriate primary category
- **AI Focus Areas**: Select all applicable areas (multi-select)
- **Size**: Base on employee count or revenue classification
- **Short Blurb**: 1-2 sentence description of AI activities
- **BC Region**: Use geographic classification system

### 3. MCP Data Validation

#### Automated Quality Checks (via MCP)
- [ ] URLs are functional and lead to correct organization
- [ ] Contact information follows database field requirements
- [ ] Geographic information matches BC Region dropdown options
- [ ] AI focus areas align with schema multi-select options
- [ ] Category placement follows database category definitions
- [ ] MCP duplicate detection confirms no existing entries

#### MCP-Based Verification Steps
1. **Database Cross-Reference**: Use MCP query tools to check existing entries
2. **Field Validation**: Ensure all data types match Notion database schema
3. **Geographic Verification**: Confirm BC presence using MCP location validation
4. **AI Focus Validation**: Verify focus areas match database taxonomy
5. **Error Detection**: Use MCP tools to identify and flag potential issues

### 4. MCP Database Integration

#### Direct MCP Entry Process
1. **Use MCP Tools**: Create new database entries directly via Model Context Protocol
2. **Validation**: MCP automatically validates field types and requirements
3. **Confirmation**: Verify successful entry through MCP database queries
3. Fill all available fields systematically
4. Set appropriate status and relationship fields
5. Add research notes and data source
6. Save and verify entry appears correctly

#### Field Mapping
- Transfer information from research template to database fields
- Convert text descriptions to appropriate select options
- Format contact information consistently
- Add any relevant file attachments (logos, documents)

## Outreach Workflow

### 1. Initial Contact Strategy

#### Contact Prioritization
- **High Priority**: Established organizations with clear AI focus
- **Medium Priority**: Emerging organizations or unclear AI involvement
- **Low Priority**: Very early stage or peripheral organizations

#### Contact Methods
1. **Warm Introductions**: Through mutual connections
2. **Direct Email**: To general contact or specific personnel
3. **LinkedIn Outreach**: Professional network connections
4. **Event Networking**: In-person introductions at events
5. **Social Media**: Twitter, LinkedIn engagement

### 2. Outreach Templates

#### Initial Contact Email
```
