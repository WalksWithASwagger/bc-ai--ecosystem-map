- **Currency**: Information updated within last 12 months preferred
- **Verification**: Use multiple sources to confirm key details
- **Attribution**: Note data sources for future reference

### Common Research Challenges & Solutions

#### Challenge: Organization Website Outdated
**Solution**: Check LinkedIn for recent updates, news articles for current status

#### Challenge: Contact Information Not Public
**Solution**: Use general info@ email, check press contact, LinkedIn message option

#### Challenge: Funding Information Unclear
**Solution**: Check Crunchbase, news articles, government filings, estimate based on team size

#### Challenge: AI Focus Not Obvious
**Solution**: Look for technology descriptions, product features, job postings mentioning ML/AI

#### Challenge: Duplicate or Similar Names
**Solution**: Verify by location, founding date, key personnel, website domain
