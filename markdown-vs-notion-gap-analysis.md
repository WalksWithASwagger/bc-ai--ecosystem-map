# Markdown vs Notion Database Gap Analysis
**Date**: January 27, 2025  
**Question**: Are there organizations in the .md files that aren't in the Notion database?

---

## üéØ **KEY FINDING: SIGNIFICANT GAP IDENTIFIED**

**YES** - There appears to be a substantial gap between what's in our markdown files and what's in the Notion database.

### **Evidence**:
The `all-organizations-masterlist.md` file lists **355 total organizations**, but many are marked as **"*(URL needed)*"** which suggests they exist in markdown but may be missing URLs or complete data in the Notion database.
