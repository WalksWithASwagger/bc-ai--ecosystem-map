# AI Companies in British Columbia: A Comprehensive Overview

## Introduction
British Columbia (BC) has emerged as a significant hub for artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in Canada, fostering a dynamic ecosystem of startups, established companies, research institutions, and academic programs. The claim of approximately 400 AI companies in BC, as referenced, aligns with recent industry data, particularly from sources like Tracxn, which reports 404 AI companies in Vancouver alone. This report explores the AI landscape in BC, provides a list of notable companies, and offers strategies for identifying the full set of AI companies to augment your existing research.

## The AI Ecosystem in British Columbia
BC's AI ecosystem is bolstered by several key factors:
- **Academic Excellence**: Institutions like the University of British Columbia (UBC), Simon Fraser University (SFU), and the University of Victoria conduct pioneering AI research, with UBC's Centre for Artificial Intelligence Decision-making and Action (CAIDA) contributing significantly.
- **Government Support**: Initiatives like the Pan-Canadian AI Strategy, the BC Tech Fund, and the Regional Artificial Intelligence Initiative (RAII) provide funding and resources to AI companies.
- **Industry Collaboration**: The AI Network of BC (AInBC), established in 2019, connects innovators, businesses, and researchers, maintaining a directory of AI organizations.
- **Venture Capital Investment**: In 2019, Canadian AI companies, including those in BC, received 57 venture capital deals totaling $658 million, with BC companies benefiting from programs like the Digital Technology Supercluster.

A 2020 report from Invest in Canada noted 103 "pure-play" AI firms in BC, compared to 361 in Ontario and 131 in Quebec. By 2025, this number has likely grown, with sources like Tracxn reporting 404 AI companies in Vancouver, suggesting a broader definition that includes companies using AI in their operations.

## Estimating the Number of AI Companies
The claim of 400 AI companies in BC is plausible, especially when considering:
- **Broad Definition**: The number likely includes startups, established companies, and divisions of larger firms that focus on or utilize AI and ML. For instance, tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, and Grammarly have AI-focused operations in Vancouver.
- **Growth Since 2020**: A 2020 Business in Vancouver article reported over 150 AI companies in BC, and with the rapid growth of the AI sector, this number could have approached 400 by 2025.
- **Data from Tracxn**: Tracxn's database lists 404 AI companies in Vancouver, including 111 funded startups, with 42 securing Series A+ funding. This figure may encompass companies across BC, as Vancouver is the primary tech hub.

However, exact numbers vary by source due to differing definitions of "AI company." For example:
- **F6S** lists 89 AI companies in Vancouver, focusing on startups.
- **Aeroleads** identifies 37 AI companies in BC, with a broader scope.
- **Invest in Canada (2020)** reported 103 pure-play AI firms in BC, likely excluding companies that use AI secondarily.

The discrepancy between 103 (2020) and 400 (2025) suggests significant growth or a more inclusive definition, possibly encompassing companies with AI divisions or those adopting AI technologies.

4. **Monitor Industry Reports**:
   - Check the **Small Business Profile 2023** from BC Stats for updates on tech and AI sectors ([www2.gov.bc.ca](https://www2.gov.bc.ca)).
   - Review the **Deloitte Canada AI Report 2023** for insights on regional AI investments ([deloitte.com](https://www2.deloitte.com)).
5. **Use Google Maps**:
   - Search for "AI companies in British Columbia" or specific cities like Vancouver and Victoria to find physical office locations, as demonstrated with companies like CoPilot AI and Apera AI.

## Challenges and Considerations
- **Definition Variability**: The number of AI companies varies by source due to differing definitions. "Pure-play" AI firms (e.g., 103 in 2020) focus solely on AI, while broader counts (e.g., 404 by Tracxn) include companies using AI secondarily.
- **Data Accessibility**: Some directories, like AInBC's, may require membership or registration, limiting public access.
- **Overlap in Lists**: Lists from F6S, Aeroleads, and Built In Vancouver may have overlapping entries, requiring deduplication.
- **Growth Trends**: The AI sector in BC has grown significantly since 2020, driven by investments and government support, making the 400 figure plausible but not definitively confirmed.

## Conclusion
British Columbia hosts a robust AI ecosystem, with approximately 400 AI companies, primarily in Vancouver, as suggested by Tracxn's database. This includes startups, established firms, and divisions of larger companies leveraging AI across industries like healthcare, finance, and robotics. By utilizing directories like Tracxn, F6S, and AInBC, along with job boards and industry reports, you can compile a comprehensive list to enhance your research. The provided list of notable companies serves as a starting point, and further exploration of these resources will help you identify the full scope of BC's AI landscape.
