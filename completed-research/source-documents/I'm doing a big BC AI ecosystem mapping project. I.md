# I'm doing a big BC AI ecosystem mapping project. I've got a notion database with like 100 entities in it, but I'm really trying to map the whole landscape, all the non-profits, industry organizations, accelerators, research institutes, companies, startups, divisions of bigger companies, all the AI machine learning specific stuff in the whole province of British Columbia. I've been finding it's a useful framework to look first at Vancouver Island, then at the lower mainland, including Vancouver, then at Kelowna and the Okanagan, and then at the north, like Prince George and Prince Rupert. I also want to make a special indigenous section, look for indigenous AI projects, make sure we add them as well. They're a key priority. I'm looking for as much detail as I can about all these people, including founders, timeline, funding, contact info, social media channels, stories in the media, any of that kind of shit.

Based on my comprehensive research of the BC AI ecosystem, I'll now create a detailed mapping that organizes the findings by geographic regions as requested, plus a special indigenous section.
